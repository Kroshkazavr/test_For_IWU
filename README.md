# test_For_IWU

Java test-tasks for junior level:
1. Application for formatting the output of a list of words.
   Print all non-empty words separated by commas, the last with 'and'.
   Output Example: "Cat, Dog, Crocodile, Fly and Bat"
2. There is a list of integers. Find the sum of numbers that are repeated at least n times in m consecutive numbers.
   Each number that satisfies the condition is counted only 1 time.
   Example: 344620045000, n = 2, m = 3;
   Solving: [344], [446], [462], [620], [200], [000] <- 4x2, 4x2, -, -, 0x2, 0x2;
   unique numbers 4 and 0 => sum = 4+0 = 4.
   Output: 4
3. Application for counting words with a given number of letters in the entered line.
